## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added `init_raw` constructor for types generated by the `store!` macro.
- Added `FilesystemClient::entry_metadata` syscall.
- Added `FilesystemClient::rename` syscall.
- Added `Syscall` implementation for `Service`.
- Added `Syscall::try_into_new_client` service.
- Added serializable flag to `StorageAttributes` for key agreement.
- Added virtual platform in `virt` module.
- Added methods for creating the client stores to `ServiceResources`.
- Implemented `unsafe_inject_key` for Aes256Cbc, Ed255, X255, P256.
- Added support for custom backends in `backend` module.
- Added optional support for API extensions in `serde_extensions` module
  behind the `serde-extensions` feature.
- Added `types::Path` re-export of `littlefs2::path::Path`.
- Reduced stack usage of `Service::process`.

### Changed

- Set `config::MAX_SERVICE_CLIENTS` based on the clients-? feature.
- Made `StorageAttributes` non-exhaustive.
- Changed `KeyStore<P: Platform>` to `KeyStore<S: Store>`.
- Replaced the client ID with a `ClientContext` struct.
- Always trigger syscall in `PollClient::request` and remove
  `PollClient::syscall`.
- Upgrade the `interchange` dependency to version 0.3.0 ([#99][])
  - As a consequence the type `pipe::TrussedInterchange` becomes a const`pipe::TRUSSED_INTERCHANGE`
- Updated `littlefs2` to 0.4.0.
- Made `Request`, `Reply`, `Error`, `Context`, `CoreContext`, `Mechanism`,
  `ui::Status` non-exhaustive.
- Made `postcard_deserialize`, `postcard_serialize` and
  `postcard_serialize_bytes` private.
- Changed `&PathBuf` to `&Path` where possible.
- Change store implementations to use littlefs2â€™s `DynFilesystem` trait instead
  of being generic over the storage implementation.
- Add `nonce` argument to `wrap_key` and `unwrap_key` syscalls.
- Use nonce as IV for Aes256Cbc mechanism.
- Updated `cbor-smol` to 0.5.0.
- Removed `serde::{Deserialize, Serialize}` implementations for the API request
  and reply structs, `types::{consent::{Error, Level}, reboot::To, StorageAttributes,
  KeySerialization, SignatureSerialization}`.
- Improved hex formatting of `types::Id`:
  - Removed the unused `Id::hex`.
  - Deprecated `Id::hex_path` and added `Id::legacy_hex_path` as a replacement.
  - Added `Id::clean_hex_path` as an alternative to `Id::legacy_hex_path`.
  - Changed `Id::hex_clean` to format zero as `"00"`.
- Change client and mechanism selection:
  - Put all client traits, requests, replies and implementations behind feature flags.
  - Put all mechanisms behind feature flags.
  - Move `CryptoClient::attest` into new `AttestationClient`.

### Fixed

- Fixed off-by-one error in `RandomBytes` request.
- Fixed a race condition when iterating over the filesystem in more than one
  client ([#64]).
- Fixed missing path validation in `Filestore` that allowed clients to escape
  their namespace ([#65]).
- wrap_key: Don't replace associated data with an empty array

### Removed

- Removed unused items:
  - `config`: `MAX_APPLICATION_NAME_LENGTH`, `MAX_LABEL_LENGTH`, `MAX_LONG_DATA_LENGTH`, `MAX_OBJECT_HANDLES`, `MAX_PATH_LENGTH`
  - `types`: `Attributes`, `CertificateType` `DataAttributes`, `KeyAttributes`, `Letters`, `LongData`, `ObjectType`
