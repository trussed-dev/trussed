//! Trait for platforms to implement that use Trussed.
//!
//! Trussed requires access to a cryptographically secure random number generator,
//! facilities for persistent and volatile storage, and some user interface to ensure
//! operations do not happen without user consent. Implementing this trait enables this.
//!
//! TODO: Currently, `Platform::R` lacks the `CryptoRng` bound.
